## This repo use LLM for Knowledge Graph construction and RAG

Note: I can't use built-in genai function in Neo4j (paid-version), so I use Chromadb to cache it

Get any docker image with apoc configuration for Neo4j

Unless I provide you data, you can only see it

You can use LLM from huggingface or APIs from Bedrock or Gemini AI. Maybe Azure-ML in the future but now I choose to use Phi-3 locally
